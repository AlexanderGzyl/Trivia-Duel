## Goal 

Trivia Duel was my final project for the full stack web development bootcamp at Concordia University. The requirements of the project were to build a full stack application that includes an external thrid party API and includes user interaction. I made a trivia app where users interact through challenging each other to trivia duels. The winning condtion for a duel is to either get more answers correct. In the event of a tie the time it takes to complete the quiz is then compared. MongoDB is used to persist quiz and user data.
